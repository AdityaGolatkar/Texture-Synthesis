%   input_image: the image containing a sample of the texture to synthesize
%   output_rows: the desired number of rows in the synthesized image
%   output_cols: the desired number of columns in the synthesized image
%   window_size: the side length of the window used to scan across the
%                input image to look for patches that most closely match
%                the region that is being synthesized
% 
% Outputs:
%   output_image: an (output_rows x output_cols) image containing the
%                 synthesized texture

% worse than the user expected.
